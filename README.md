# Final-Project
Data product creation for DATA 824 class. Shiny app from R.

As an AP teacher, I was curious what kinds of data are out there about AP exams and their scores.
Where and how well is the AP program growing or declining over the years?

I chose a dataset about the number of AP exams by region (specifically US states for this analysis) from 2012 to 2022.

# How does it work?
When you first open the shiny app via R, it displays default data (2012 to 2022 by "count").
You have the option to change starting and ending year as well as "count" vs "percent".
